# LearnPrologNow Knowledge Bases

Just a compendium of the knowledge bases used by the [Learn Prolog Now!](http://www.learnprolognow.org/) book. Written for compatibility with SWI-Prolog.

It’s not particularly laborious to create these yourself, and you should consider doing it...but this also does make it a bit easier to just jump right in on one thing or another :)

## File layout
Files are all organized under subdirectories by chapter. Within that, they are numbered in order, and prefixed in one of three ways depending on the section they’re from:

* `kb` indicates a knowledge base from the initial expository part of the chapter.
* `e` indicates data for an exercise, where appropriate (not all exercises work from knowledge bases).
* `p` indicates data supporting the final part of each chapter, the “practical session”.

Note that the book sometimes calls back data from earlier chapters. It also may or may not explicitly number the knowledge bases; if it does not, we just assign a serial id.
